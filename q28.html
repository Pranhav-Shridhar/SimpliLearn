<!-- What do you understand by pseudo-elements?

Pseudo-elements provide special effects to some selectors. CSS finds use in applying styles in HTML markups. If additional markup or style is not feasible for a document, the pseudo-elements help by allowing extra markup without interfering with the original document.  -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      p::first-line {
        color: #ff0000;
        font-variant: small-caps;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      You can use the ::first-line pseudo-element to add a special effect to the
      first line of a text. Some more text. And even more, and more, and more,
      and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and more, and
      more, and more.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
