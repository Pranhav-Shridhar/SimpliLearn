<!-- How is a CSS selector used?

With a CSS selector, we can choose the content we want to style to bridge between HTML files and style sheets. CSS selector syntax is "select" HTML elements created on their class, id, type, etc.  -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      p {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>Every paragraph will be affected by the style.</p>
    <p id="para1">Me too!</p>
    <p>And me!</p>
  </body>
</html>
