<!-- Tell us about the property used for image scroll controlling?

The background-attachment property is used to set whether the background image is fixed or it scrolls with the rest of the page. Example for a fixed background-image:

body {

  background-image: url(‘url_of_image’);

  background-repeat: no-repeat;

  background-attachment: fixed;

} -->
